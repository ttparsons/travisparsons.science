        <h1>LA Sight</h1>
     
      <p>[<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-sight-los-angeles?hrid=LVDPoNBllW4s2_cW2W7uOg" target="_blank">Below is a longer version of my original Yelp review here posted 1/3/2018</a>]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I highly recommend LA Sight, Dr. Wallace &amp; his staff were all fantastic. I was slightly nearsighted (-1.5) before LASIK, but now I can see better than 20/20 (now 20/15). I have no negative side effects except slight dry eye, which is supposed to be temporary (and I can already tell it is improving 2 weeks out). LA Sight did an amazing job and I definitely recommend anyone interested to check them out. To give you a full picture of what to expect here, I wrote a pretty long description so hopefully prospective patients find it useful!</p>
        <p>I live in Las Vegas, but have family in Southern California so I opted to go with LA-based Lasik surgeons rather than where I am now. I settled on LA Sight based on reviews and the fact that they are a single provider, not part of a large practice with multiple offices - that was just my personal preference though. I liked seeing the same people on every appointment.</p>
        <p>I came in for 3 consecutive days, the first was the consultation and pre-op, the next was the operation, and the last was the check-up. The first 2 days took about an hour each, the check up only took about 15 minutes. During the pre-op my eyes were dilated which gave me a headache for the rest of the day, so be prepared for that. If you arrive early you can find free parking on the adjacent residential streets, just watch out for street sweeping schedules posted.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wallace uses custom wavefront correction for all the procedures, but offers different flap creation methods. At the time of my procedure, there was: Conventional microkeratome ($1400/eye), all laser ($1750/eye) and RELEX SMILE ($1750/eye). I opted for the microkeratome, as my corneal thickness was fine and Dr. Wallace himself said I could go with any method I wanted. He said the $700 extra goes literally to the cost of running the laser itself, and that he doesn’t upcharge at all for it. I really appreciated his candor in explaining each method openly, without trying to do any sort of up sell.</p>
        <p>My prescription going in was a mild -1.5 in both eyes with a very slight astigmatism in one. They measured my eyes at least 4 times to make sure everything was consistent - they really are careful and precise with their diagnostics. The $2800 mentioned above was all I paid, there were no other fees or upcharges. To others considering LASIK, however, realize you do need to buy some prescriptions and eye drops in addition. I was prescribed PREDNISOLONE ACETATE (steroid) and OFLAXACIN (antibiotic) and the cost to me was about $28, with my insurance paying the other $28. You will also need several boxes of artificial tears that are preservative free (each box is about ~$10 for ~36 vials which will last you about a month).</p>
        <p>Prior to the surgery/consultation I stopped wearing my soft contact lenses 2 weeks in advance (you need them out longer for rigid lenses). The day before/of the surgery and consultation I also stopped drinking alcohol and caffeine as these can dehydrate you. I also had to practice not touching my eyes in the shower, as you need to avoid this after surgery. In addition, I started taking Omega 3 supplements, as these are reported to sometimes help with eye hydration. I did all of this based on internet research, as I didn’t actually see Dr. Wallace until the day before since I lived out of state.</p>
        <p>The day of surgery was extremely easy. They prescribe a valium and let you sit in a nice relaxation room. The surgery itself was only about 10-15 minutes. They tape your eyelids and eye lashes back and then insert a speculum that keeps you from blinking. From here, because I chose the microkeratome they placed a small metal platform on my eye which suctioned down. Towards the end of the suctioning is when I had my first uncomfortable feeling – kind of like your eye popping a little bit outward – but on a scale from 1 to 10 (10 being extremely uncomfortable) it was honestly a 3. As other reviews have said, it isn't really painful, just uncomfortable. Next the blade slides across the front of your eye and you can feel it vibrating. When this was done on my first eye it was more like a 4 or 5 on the scale above with a little pain. The second eye it was more like a 3. It felt more or less like something painful in your eye, such as an eyelash or a contact that got lost in your eye. After that everything was easy – throughout all the other steps (placing a tracking dye, measuring thickness, opening flap, closing flap) I barely felt a thing.</p>
        <p>Immediately afterward I could tell I was no longer nearsighted, but there was a bit of haze / double vision. They checked the flap and gave me an eye shield (you have to wear it through your first night of sleep) and sent me on my way. I slept for an hour in the car ride home and then another 3 hours at home. When I woke up everything was clear and great! I had a mild sensation of something being in my eye for the rest of the day but then I was fine the next day. At the follow up appointment they confirmed I was now seeing better than 20/20 (now 20/15). I can see slightly better than I did with contacts/glasses.</p>
        <p>For the next 3 days you have to use your prescriptions 3 times a day (morning, afternoon, and night). In between you use the artificial tears to keep your eyes happy. I am now about two weeks out from surgery and seeing great. I could be wrong, but I think a huge benefit from the procedure was having it correct for my slight astigmatism, I didn't realize how much sharper my vision would be after having that fixed. There is extremely small glare noticeable at night when driving, but its extremely comparable to what I already had with contacts.</p>
        <p>For more info regardless of where you get LASIK you should check out their website, as it has a LOT of technical information that really explains the science behind it all (see example <a href="http://www.la-sight.com/lasik-prk/Wavelight/wavefront-optimization" target="_blank">here</a>) I was not a fan of how watered down many sites were, so as someone coming from a technical background having access to the detailed info at LA Sight was fantastic. Thanks again to LA Sight for a wonderful change in my quality of life, it was absolutely worth it and you guys were great! See you for my 1 month follow up.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Update at about 5 weeks post surgery: </strong>Eye sight is still 20/15 and doing great! At around the 3 week mark I started having times when it felt like something was in my eye - yet nothing was there and eye drops didn't help. After doing some research online, I found suggestions to use gel-based eye drops at night. This completely solved the problem, though I'm not sure why the regular eye drops didn't at least provide some relief. Anyhow, if you run into similar issues, give it a try (I bought <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Systane-Lubricant-Anytime-Protection-0-33-FL/dp/B004IXZJ4W" target="new">Systane Gel </a>drops - they're also coupons you can get from Systane for them that give $3 off). These will blue your vision signficiantly so you only want to use them at night, but they do seem to dramatically help recovery (anecdotally). Once I started using these, I also felt no need to use the preservative free drops any more during the day. My eyes feel fine without them, and they also feel better getting more oxygen then they did with contacts on. All I use now is the gel drops at night and regular eye drops when I wake up, as my eyes are dry in the morning after sleeping. I'm planning to finish up all the drops I have (because why let them go to waste) and hopefully by that time I will be 100% back to normal. As it stands currently I am no longer concerned about dry eye, and everything appears to be healing fine!</p>
