<h3>Car Menu</h3>
<p>There's a lot of phone mounts for your car nowadays, but there's not much use to them - your phone is far away and hard to use if you want to pull over and do something. This tasker program I wrote allows you to have a nice menu pop up (with whatever you want on it) when you trigger it with something like the press of your <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kinivo-BTC450-Bluetooth-Hands-Free-Input/dp/B009NLTW60/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1437533300&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=bluetooth+adapter+car" target="new">Bluetooth button</a>.</p>
<p><center><img src="../images/programs/carmenu/carmenu.png"></center></p>
<p>The first image shows the menu and all of its available functions (the bottom slider sets the screen brightness). Next to it is what comes up when you press &quot;Music Menu&quot; (lets you start any music service you like). At the bottom left, you see a menu that pops up when you speak a reply to a text message so you can ensure it is correct before it gets sent. At the bottom right is a popup that arrives when you get a text informing you of the sender (with the option to show the message if you like). Due to possible issues with people using this while driving and getting in an accident, I don't want to release the code - but hopefully this inspires some creative ideas for people on how to use Tasker.</p>

<p>1.) <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yado.btbut&amp;hl=en" target="new">Smart Bluetooth Headset</a> (Kind of optional. I use this to trigger the task that opens the menu when I double press on my bluetooth adapter.)<br />

  4.) <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.launcher&amp;hl=en" target="new">Google Now</a> (Can be launched from the menu, and is used for some stuff)<br />
