<h3>What is Tasker?</h3>
<p>Tasker is a very sophisticated Android application that  allows you to run complicated scripts on your phone. You can program it to run &ldquo;tasks&rdquo;  when certain &ldquo;profiles&rdquo; are active.</p>
<p>For example, you can create a profile that turns your WiFi  off when you leave your house. Or, you can create a profile that says the  current traffic conditions out loud when you start your car (See my below  tutorials!). It is very easy to learn once you figure out how it works. It is a  fun way to make your life a little easier.</p>
<p>You can visit <a href="http://tasker.dinglisch.net/download.html" target="new">this link</a> to download it onto your phone for a  free 7 day trial, or you can go ahead and purchase it from the Google Play  store <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm" target="new">here</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no comparable program for the  iPhone.</p>
